<article> About me </article>
<p> My name is Cameron Yablonski, ever since I discovered at a young age that creativity is one of my greatest skills and <em>media design</em> has always been a passion of mine, I decided to pursue a career in interactive media design. I used any software I could get my hands on, and ever since I bought some of the Adobe software, I feel as though the media I have access to is limitless.Since I discovered at a young age that creativity is one of my greatest skills and media design has always been a passion of mine, I decided to pursue a career in interactive media design.

<p2>My academic experience has thus far been a rollercoaster of ups and downs, whether it's been putting off assignments till the last minute or assisting those who are having trouble. I always manage to get by just fine. For me, graduating from high school was a very bizarre experience since, as a small child, I always imagined that I had a long way to go before I could graduate. However, when the time came, it was such a weirdly bittersweet experience. </p2>
